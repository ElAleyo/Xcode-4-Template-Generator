In that article you will find a lot of information about what is currently known about the new Xcode Template System.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nBased on the original code by Ricardo Quesada (@ricardoquesada) for the cocos2d project, modifications & ugly hacks by Nicolas Goles Domic (@MrGando).","tagline":"Script to help in the process of making Xcode 4 Templates.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
